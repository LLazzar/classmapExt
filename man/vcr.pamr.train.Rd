\title{
Prepare for visualization of a pamr (NSC) classification on training data.
}
\description{
Produces output for the purpose of constructing graphical displays such as the \code{silplot}, \code{qresplot} and \code{\link{mdscolorscale}}. The user first needs train a pamr model (Nearest Shrunken Centroid) on the data by \code{pamr::train}. This then serves as an argument to \code{\link{vcr.pamr.train}}.
}

\usage{
vcr.pamr.train(data, pamrfit, pamrfitcv=NULL, threshold)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{

\item{data}{Exactly the same input data used to produce \code{pamrfit}, that is a list with components: \code{$x} with genes expression levels in the rows (samples in the columns); \code{$y} is REQUIRED to be factor with the class labels for each sample. Data should be feeded to \code{pamr.train} already factorized. Additional components: $genenames, a vector of gene names, and $geneid a vector of gene identifiers.}
\item{pamrfit}{The output of a \code{pamr::pamr.train} fit on \code{data}}
\item{pamrfitcv}{The output of a \code{pamr::pamr.cv} run with the \code{pamrfit} object. If feeded the cross-validated results are prepared for visualization instead of the results on the normal training process. Default is \code{NULL}}
\item{threshold}{Define the threshold at which training classification results are to be evaluated. This is because \code{pamrfit} includes multiple models, each linked to a unique threshold from a vector of discrete values. The first threshold value in \code{pamrfit}, exceeding the inputted \code{threshold}, is selected.}
}


\value{
A list with components:
  \item{yint}{number of the given class of each case.}
  \item{y}{given class label of each case.}
  \item{levels}{levels of \code{y}}
  \item{predint}{predicted class number of each case. For each case this is the class with the highest posterior probability. Always exists.}
  \item{pred}{predicted label of each case.}
  \item{altint}{number of the alternative class. Among the classes different from the given class, it is the one with the highest posterior probability. Is \code{NA} for cases whose \code{y} is missing.}
  \item{altlab}{label of the alternative class. Is \code{NA} for cases whose \code{y} is missing.}
  \item{fig}{farness of each case \eqn{i} from each class \eqn{g}. Is \code{NULL} if distToClass is not feeded.}
  \item{farness}{farness of each case from its given/true class. Is \code{NULL} if distToClass is not feeded.}
  \item{ofarness}{for each case \eqn{i}, its lowest \eqn{fig[i,g]} to any class \code{g}. Is \code{NULL} if distToClass is not feeded.}
  \item{pamrfit}{The \code{pamrfit} object taken as input.}
  \item{pamrfitcv}{The \code{pamrfitcv} object taken as input, if provided.}
  \item{threshold}{The effective threshold value evaluated.}
  \item{ii}{The index of the threshold value evaluated.}
  \item{pwd}{Matrix containing pairwise distances for the considered set of cases. The distance measure is devised based on the sense of proximity between data points of the trained classifier in its decision space. Necessary input to \code{\link{mdscolorscale}}.}
